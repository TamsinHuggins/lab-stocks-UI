- Vite is a build tool for the project.
- NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for JavaScript that allows developers to install, share, and manage dependencies for their projects.

### Choose JavaScript

There is something called Babel, which is the compiler that turns React (JSX) code into vanilla JavaScript that the browser can interpret.


 ## Run the project with its starter code

 Go into the folder created by Vite

```
cd .\react-stocks-demo\
```

Install dependencies 

```
npm install
```

Run the project

```
npm run dev
```
If you get  " 'vite' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file. " then you forgot to install - run npm install.
